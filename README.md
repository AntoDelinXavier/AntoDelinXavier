## About Me
I am a Data Science graduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park, with an engineering background and hands-on experience in machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics. I specialize in transforming data into actionable insights and building predictive systems that optimize decision-making and operational efficiency. My focus areas include supervised learning, NLP, recommendation systems, and data-driven business solutions.

## Experience

**Data Science Intern – Axion Ray, New York, USA**  
*May 2025 – Aug 2025*  
- Built a customer churn prediction model using Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost) and SQL on Azure Databricks; achieved 89% ROC-AUC and enabled proactive retention campaigns.  
- Designed and fine-tuned a Generative AI pipeline (OpenAI GPT + LangChain) to summarize support tickets, reducing manual triage time by approximately 50%.  
- Automated MLOps workflows with MLflow and Docker for experiment tracking, model registry, and deployment, reducing release cycles by 30%.

**Data Analyst & Project Owner – Axion Ray, Bangalore, India**  
*Jun 2023 – Jul 2024*  
- Led the transition of a proof of concept to production for three enterprise clients.  
- Applied Prompt Engineering with GPT, BERT, and Claude to automate data mining and achieve 95% accuracy in NLP-based analytics.  
- Developed and optimized sentiment analysis and topic modeling pipelines using Transformers and attention mechanisms.  
- Created end-to-end pipelines using Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and SQL for automated analytics.

**Graduate Engineering Trainee – Carborundum Universal Ltd, Hosur, India**  
*Aug 2022 – May 2023*  
- Built a Ridge Regression model for analyzing machine-material correlations, reducing product defects by 25%.  
- Implemented Lean and TQM process improvements, cutting grinding costs by 75%.  
- Created Power BI dashboards and integrated MongoDB with PostgreSQL to accelerate report generation.
